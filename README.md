# Zumi-IRC-2021 
This code is for the Robolink's Zumi International Robotics Competition 2021. 

## Goal of this competiton
### "This year's challenge is called "Cruise to the Park". Your goal is to navigate from the START position to the FINISH position in the park. It's a fully autonomous challenge, meaning from when Zumi leaves the START position until the FINISH position, Zumi cannot be controlled or touched. It will require you to master driving skills and some of Zumiâ€™s AI capabilities by utilizing her camera to recognize a STOP sign, using AI to learn red and green, and reading QR codes to navigate the field." -Robolink
